# Factory Design Pattern
The creational.factory design pattern is used when we have a superclass with multiple sub-classes and based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class. This pattern takes out the responsibility of the instantiation of a class from the client program to the creational.factory class. Letâ€™s first learn how to implement a creational.factory design pattern in java and then we will look into creational.factory pattern advantages. We will see some of the creational.factory design pattern usage in JDK. Note that this pattern is also known as Factory Method Design Pattern.
