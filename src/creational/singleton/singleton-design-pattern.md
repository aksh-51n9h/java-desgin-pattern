# Singleton Design Pattern
- Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class and ensures that only one instance of the class exists in the Java Virtual Machine. 
- The singleton class must provide a global access point to get the instance of the class. 
- Singleton pattern is used for logging, drivers objects, caching, and thread pool. 
- Singleton design pattern is also used in other design patterns like Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype, Facade, etc.
